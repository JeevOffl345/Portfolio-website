      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m an undergraduate student pursuing BTech Computer Science(Data
        Science) in VIT Chennai. I'm deeply passionate about web development. I
        started with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I’m currently learning
        React. This portfolio is my first project to apply what I’ve learned.
        I’m excited to continue improving and contributing to real-world
        projects.
